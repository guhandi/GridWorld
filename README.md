# GridWorld
Using reinforcement learning to determine state/action values based on various policies. Different monte carlo methods implemented and results compared with plots. 

# PersonalisedGridWorld(p)
Contains the function that sets up the Grid World
with p probability of successful transition and returns the full MDP information

# GridWorldRL()
Runs the RL algorithm to and uses the value function in various applications. 
Contains all the necessary function:
  - PolicyEvaluation
  - Traces
  - MonteCarlo Policy Evaluation
  - eGreedy MC
